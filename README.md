# Map Track

Get a group of friends together. You can play with 2-10 players.

## Goal of the Game

There is one runner, and the rest are trackers. The runner needs to evade the trackers until caught. There is a catch to the game though. The runner is being tracked through their smart phone, and the trackers can find where the runner is on their phone.

Get ready to run!

## Tips

Play Maptrack on a university, or where there are multiple open buildings with many floors. The runner will have an advantage playing in buildings with multiple floors. The map will not show which floor the runner is on. Trackers will know where the runner is, but they would have to find him in the building.

Keep your phone's screen on!

## Instructions

Make sure that everyone in the same group inputs the same session ID number.  Once the session ID number is inputed, then have everyone input their name.  Then click "Join Session".  Once all the participants have joined, click "Pick Runner" and then "Start".  Once the runner is caught, then have everyone click "Close Session".

### Runner

The runner will be randomly picked on the wait screen.
